Two papers were accepted at the 2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN).
Both papers are related to my former master's student Lucca.

The first is about dynamic classifier selection in data streams and is a collaboration with Professor Alceu de Souza Britto Jr. and Laurent Heutte (LITIS/Universit√© of Rouen):

The second regards performance pitfalls in current data stream mining solutions and is a collaboration with Professor Marco Zanata (UFPR).
