I'm an Associate Professor with the [Graduate Program in Informatics (PPGIa)](https://www.ppgia.pucpr.br/pt/) of the [Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná (PUCPR)](https://www.pucpr.br).
My research focuses on machine learning, more specifically on data stream mining.
More specifically, I'm currently working on the following topics:

* Supervised learning: data stream classification and regression
* Unsupervised learning: data stream clustering and outlier detection
* Data pre-processing: how to handle high-dimensionality, text data, etc, on streaming data
* Distributed stream processing
* Green computing: the gap between machine learning and power consumption
* Machine learning and Law: the intersection between these areas w.r.t. applications of ML in Law, and vice-versa, such as GDPR and the Brazilian LGPD

If you're also interested in any of the topics above, either in theoretical or applied ends, and you would like to pursuit a degree or collaborate, feel free to drop me a message using the link below. Also, feel free to check my [Lattes CV here (in Portuguese)](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5862618116527136) for an updated list of publications.

I'm currently in the last year of my studies where I target dynamic feature selection for Data Stream Mining. I'm also a proud contributor to the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) framework.
